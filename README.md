# Impacts_of_ScienceMajors_STEMOccupations

Stereotype about intellectual ability, in addition to occupational prestige, especially when it comes to gender prestige at work, has long been believed to be one of the real roots of the wage gap. In this project, I attempted to empirically explain the difference in the total person’s income of science versus non-science majors, STEM versus non-STEM workers, and whether the two factors play an important role in narrowing the gender wage gap for women, after controlling for different individuals’ and households’ characteristics. 


This repository is contains information on the analysis about the effect of having a Science majors, and/or a STEM occupation, and whether the two factors play an important role in narrowing the gender wage gap for women. This is an in-depth research from my intitial analysis that had been done in 2017, on the relationship between median income, women's representation and college majors 

My 2017 analysis was an extension on an article by *FiveThirtyEight*.

The result of their project was published as [an article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/) *The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major* on their website in 2014.

My 2018 in-dept analysis uses data from the U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS) in 2016.
